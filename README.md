The Item URL Helper adds two great features to the Content Manager that will enrich your life as a content editor or developer. The first is the ability to right click an item and have the item’s URL copied directly to your clipboard. Wow, now that alone is a huge time saver! This alleviates us from building a URL by the item path and now we can select a URL for different devices as well! The second feature is just as robust. You can now take a URL and paste it into the Search Box above the Content Tree and go directly to the item. No more staring at a URL and drilling down the Content Tree!
